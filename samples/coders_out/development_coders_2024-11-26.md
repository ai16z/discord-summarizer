## Action Items

### Technical Tasks
- Contribute to ai16z codebase (mentioned by @VI)
- Debug common failure points for initializing Twitter client: invalid credentials, network issues, API rate limits, outdated library versions and environment variables. Share findings. (mentioned by @FattyBagz)
- Resolve Twitter client initialization issue by setting up API credentials, installing required libraries (axios or fetch), creating trading functions for buy/sell actions with proper error handling. (mentioned by EdwardLazz)
- Configure Eliza to properly handle API calls by modifying the following files: src/api/index.js, src/config/config.js and create a trading plugin in src/plugins/trading.js. (mentioned by EdwardLazz)
- Format the TWITTER_COOKIES environment variable as valid JSON string with proper escaping of quotes and no trailing commas. Example: 'TWITTER_COOKIES='[{ (mentioned by EdwardLazz)
- Set up API credentials for exchange and install required libraries like axios. (mentioned by @fudme)
- Add validation check for 'contractAddress' before creating a PublicKey to prevent Base58 error. (mentioned by @EdwardLazz)
- Correct the JSON structure in `character.json` by replacing '[object Object]' with actual API key for HEURIST plugin. (mentioned by @CaptainCool)
- Implement validation check in the appropriate file within Eliza codebase, likely `plugin-solana/src/index.js`. (mentioned by @EdwardLazz and @Bel)
- Locate provider files for processing recommendations (mentioned by @EdwardLazz)
- Validate contract addresses before creating PublicKey instances to resolve base58 errors. (mentioned by @EdwardLazz)
- Incorporate address validation logic in 'evaluators/trust.ts' file where recommendations are processed, and log addresses for debugging purposes. (mentioned by @EdwardLazz)
- Format tweet content dynamically based on recommendation details to include conviction level and token ticker in agent's tweets. Implement this logic where recommendations are handled. (mentioned by @EdwardLazz)
- Investigate PostgreSQL adapter usage issue (mentioned by @0xM1M3)

### Documentation Needs
- Provide correct format of TWITTER_COOKIES environment variable as JSON string, without outer brackets. Replace placeholders with actual values. (mentioned by @FattyBagz)
- Configure Argent wallet to execute a swap (mentioned by @EdwardLazz)

### Feature Requests
- Troubleshoot 'pnpm start' command for bigxiang with error message and character file path verification. (mentioned by @bigxiang)
- Align Eliza's codebase with Virtuals.io by reviewing architectural decisions, API integration compatibility and data structures for consistency. (mentioned by EdwardLazz)
- Add validation check to ensure PublicKey is not null or empty before creating a transaction. (mentioned by @Bel)
- Consider using bitquery for enhanced recommendation data and explore 'dexscreeners' as an additional resource. (mentioned by @dnx)

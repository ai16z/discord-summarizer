## Summary
The discussion focused on using 'twikit' library to scrape tweets as an alternative method. The feasibility of a Discord bot handling trading and securing funding was questioned, with the conclusion that it is not its intended purpose but rather for general queries/tasks.

## FAQ
- Can the Discord bot handle trading or secure funding? What is its connection to financial crypto stuff? (asked by [DegenSpartan] (00:07))
- Does ai16z project already have a Twitter scraper implemented using 'twikit' library? (asked by [Ophiuchus](00:38))
- Did you guys top up credit for the API in OpenAI to make your bot work? And if so, how much was it and where can I do that too? (asked by [Kevin](01:06))
- Why would we need an alternative for the Twitter API's 7-day limit? Is there a cost associated with extending it beyond this period, or is another approach more viable? (asked by [ferric | stakeware.xyz](01:09))
- What hardware are you running your agent on? What's the setup like? (asked by @SotoAlt | WAWE (01:20))
- Is it possible to train models using data other than tweets, such as writing and podcast transcripts? How much compute power is required for this kind of training? (01:23) (asked by @ferric | stakeware.xyz)
- What's the difference between your character file input method compared to others? (asked by @ferric | stakeware.xyz)
- Are you using OpenAI API or local? Are RTXs needed if ai16z moons? What hardware are u aiming to run this locally for cost calculation and performance comparison? (asked by @SotoAlt | WAWE)
- How do I train the model on my end with hiroP's setup in prod environment, considering prompt caching techniques used by Anthropic as a reference point due to high costs? (asked by @Kevin)
- How can I get the bot to be relevant when Marc is mentioned? What are some alternatives without calling APIs? (asked by [big dookie])

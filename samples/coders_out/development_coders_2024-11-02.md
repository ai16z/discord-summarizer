## Summary
The discussion revolved around the necessity and impact of fine-tuning in Spartan model, with a focus on potential issues related to character file. SotoAlt | WAWE suggested an issue might be present within the pricing page's character files.

## FAQ
- Is fine-tuning necessary for Spartan model? Did they apply it to the character profile? (asked by [big dookie (06:38)])
- How can we incorporate Mochi into our project quickly and effectively? (asked by [whobody])
- What model are you using? Yours looks like it is outputting some good things. Is there any fine-tuning yet, just prompts or something else? (06:42) - Answered by whobody and big dookie (asked by Tenji)
- Has anyone tried Mistral small with a capacity of around 22 billion parameters? (asked by naturevrm)
- How can we make the abstract concept more understandable? What media or events could help communicate it better? (asked by whobody (06:47))
- Why are quantized models dumber on GPU vs CPU, and how does this affect their performance in different environments? (asked by big dookie)
- How were you able to get yours to stop spitting the same response no matter the question?@SotoAlt | WAWE answered: Deleting the database file solved it. Also, check for syntax or logic errors in character files. (asked by @Tenji)
- What temp do you guys like to set the models at? I think im finally starting to get somewhere with my agents responses. (asked by @Tenji)
- Any ticket that is beginner friendly / good first issue that also helps with code onboarding ? (asked by @sayonara)
- Whatever u want till it clicks for you. Use intuition. (asked by @whobody)

## Summary
. The primary technical discussion revolved around a model-related embedding problem. @hiroP(00:01) reported receiving errors due to embeddings, which was later identified as the issue of an undefined `modelProvider`. Ophiuchus (00:07), proposed switching from main codebase to postgres for resolving this error by calculating embedding distance and parsing JSON messages. Ferric | stakeware.xyz(00:05) also suggested fixing a bug in getCachedEmbeddings.

## FAQ
- I'm getting a model related error but it seems to be due to embedding. Can I see the settings section of a characterfile that works? Please! Could you share this with me? (asked by @hiroP(00:01))
- I'm getting an 'embeddingModel undefined error'. What could be causing it and how can I fix the issue? (asked by @hiroP(00:03))
- What should I do for the latest version of embeddings? Can you guide me on setting up modelProvider in .env or characterfile correctly with OAi key included? (asked by @hiroP)
- Can we discuss more about what's not working and the error message related to embeddings? Are there specific models/libraries causing issues or any debugging steps taken so far? (asked by @Ophiuchus, @Eliza)
- 'how do i force a rebuild of adapter-sqlite?' and 'why isn't pnpm run --rebuild working on Node v23?' (asked by [ferric | stakeware.xyz])
- What is not working with the embeddings, which model or library are you using? (asked by [Eliza (00:15)])
- 'what value u are getting for console.log(\ (asked by [Ophiuchus](00:43))
- do we need to migrate to postgres or some other DB? (asked by [Dorian] (01:26))
- im using openai api, might check that (asked by [SotoAlt | WAWE](01:23))
- How was the SQLite bug handled? (link to PR #261) (asked by [Dorian](01:52))

## Summary
@big dookie suggested implementing chunking for Twitter context understanding. The discussion also involved training and hosting a fine-tuned Llama model locally with bigger GPU support, which is crucial in enhancing the performance of these models.

## FAQ
- Are most of you using gpt4 + claude, an already fine-tuned llama like Pygmalion or something, or your own fine tuned Llama? Where do you train and host your llama? (asked by @dmg)
- How can I enable the AI Agent to trade tokens in Eliza setup on Discord? (asked by @encrypted)
- Is Jupiter API integration available? What's the goal of creating characters and avatars? (asked by SotoAlt | WAWE)
- Should we focus on quantity or quality for character creation? How many people work at this company, where am I in all these projects? (asked by whobody)
- How to get the 6 seconds of video and last frame for using comfy? What is Lincoln's birthday? How can I make FFmpeg work with moving effects on a static image? (asked by @big dookie)
- How to get the audio-reactivity system shitposting tweets as Gary Andresen and what is his birthday? How can I implement beat matching for low octave sounds in ThreeJS? (asked by @big dookie)
- What can I use with web audio API and an npm package to make glitch effects easier than GD commands? What are some alternatives for image cuts according to music using transient peaks, specifically on a static looped image aiming at lofi-style digital destruction based on amplitude? (asked by [whobody])
- How can I apply glitch effects that move with the waveform without getting too complex? Is it possible to shift layered chroma values using ffmpeg, and how could this be automated in a pipeline process like fluent-ffmpeg? (asked by [big dookie])
- Could you suggest an alternative approach for applying glitch effects on static images based on sound? Would it involve extracting RGB layers of the image and warping/graining them according to audio input, or is there another method? (asked by [Poe])
- Are you building teh prerequisites to make Mairc visible in video? (asked by @big dookie)
